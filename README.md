# Web application for generating electrical invoices
I developed a web app that generates electricity bills based on monthly consumption and uploaded photos. It also manages customer data, automates annual consumption, and provides a dashboard for statistics. Other features include a complaint filing system, geographical area management by agents, and pricing calculated based on monthly unit price.
